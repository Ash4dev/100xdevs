v1:

lts: long term support(for production level stuff) else new
variables: use let to avoid scope issues with var
var: global, let: local

v2:

old lang: ECMA standards ensure back compatibility
"use strict" ensures bad correct syntax turns into errors(undeclared vars, delete)
alert only works on browser, not on nodejs
don't give up readability for correctness(; write on same file similar as python )
null: deliberately valuelss, undefined: indeliberately valuelss
symbol(identify unique) & object: 
null doesn't have its won data type, it is an "object" while others have their own data type
typeof to determine type of variable. Note typeof(null) or typeof null-> object

v3:
input data type from user is rarely correct, make sure to convert to desired type only after checking if they are not values like null, undefined etc
forcefull conversion of data types is always possible, however may not behave appropriately.
Number values null -> 0, non-int string, undefined -> NaN, bool -> 1 (true)

v4:
use parenthesis for max clarity in operations (no precedence timepass)

v5:
make sure to always compare same type of data types
=== checks value as well as datatype (preferrable)

== works differently than the >,<,>=,<=(null->0) 
undefined always converted to zero

v6,7:
JS: dynamically typed language (datatypes assigned at runtime)

primitive(uses stack memory: get copy, stack): 
String, Number(no floats, doubles), Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol(gives unique identifier for same value and type), BigInt(23232424324n)

non-primitive(uses heap memory: get reference, heap) 
Array, Objects, Functions(function object type)

v8:
use backticks(f string analog) for string printing, no concatonation stuff.
whenever we declare variable with new, it leads to creation of an object not the primitive datatype
0-indexed language
strings are immutable in JS(mutable in c++), even if they are an object
slice is substring with -ve valies 
check gfg string js reference summary (trim: space & '\n')

v9:
lack of explicit determination is why typescript was needed
length is a property of string
toFixed is useful to limit precision

Math.random() is really important (0-1) non-inclusive
When dealing with limits put max and min values of Math.random()

v10:
current date handling: Date object has some problems(supports Gregorian Calendar only, time and date computations not easy) -> Temporal (sol not yet out)

epoch: Jan1,1970 UTC
time: miliseconds passed since epoch (range: +-100M/365 yrs)
0 indexed months
Compare time of 2 cases using miliseconds
