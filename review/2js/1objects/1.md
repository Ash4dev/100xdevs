v1:
0-indexed, resizable, mix different data types
only shallow copy allowed(reference based copy) not deep copy(value based copy)

prototype: built-in prop of all JS objects; chain of prototypes is formed as prototype has its prototype, ends at null

***optimization is done after successful operation***

console.log(Array.from({name: "John"})) -> [] ??

v2:
Object.freeze(obj_name) // pickling
safe access: obj["key name"]
// same object can be referenced with this (self like)

v3:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern-introduction/
let user = new Object() // singleton object(only single instance of class is required to control the action throughout the execution globally: *logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections*)
let user = {} // non-singleton object
functionally both are the same

we can nest objects as much as we want
