v2:

Scope pertains to the visibility of variables

var: global scope 
let, const: local scope

expression based function declaration: functions to be called after declaration
plainly declared functions place no restriction

functions can be defined inside any scope in js but not in cpp

v3:

context refers to the object to which a function belongs
this keyword: access current context variables & functions in *objects-objects only*, but can see other internal properties when used in functions and other objects

current global context in : 
1. node.js/bun.js: empty
2. browser: window 

implicit return: return what is in parenthesis
explicit return: must define scope

IIFE: immeadiately invoked function expressions
benefits: 
1. explicit fn call *not necessary*(possible) for execution
2. no values collision bwn same named local & global var

IIFE: named/unnamed (helpful when there were no let/const)

1st paren: convert to expression
2nd paren: execute expression

v5:

JS engine(V8: chromium, node.js; spidermonkey: firefox) executes JS code on behalf of browsers, etc.

JS engines scan JS file & create execution context, that are responsible for handling transformation & code execution.

2 execution contexts exist:
1. global(always: keyword this)
2. function

When the context runs, parser parses the source code & 2 components are created:

1. variable env: allocates memory for variable & functions.
2. thread of execution: single threaded(line-by-line execution: interpreted & only sequential: synchronous) by default

Process:
1. Global Execution Context created.
2. Memory allocated
    1. variables: undefined
    2. function: definition
3. Execution Started
    1. variables: get respective values changes in memory phase
    2. functions: create own execution context
        1. context created based on func definition
        2. return value to its parent execution context
        3. gets terminated after completely executed

Synchronous Execution Contexts are put into a stack as the child execution contexts needs to be resolved first & popped out. This is known as the call stack.

          ---------------------------- top of stack
(Close)   |Global->Function1->Function2 (Open)
          ---------------------------- top of stack

There is a limit on the max size of the stack, leading to stack overflow(recursion w no base case).

Meanwhile, asynchronous execution contexts are made to wait in a callback queue, if the thread is busy with working with some other function.

        front of queue -------------------------- 
(Open)  AsyncF1<-AsyncF2<-AsyncF3<-AsyncF4<-AsyncF5 (Close)
        front of queue --------------------------
