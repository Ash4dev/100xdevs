v1:
# Document Object Model (DOM) 
- programming interface for web documents. (way to access HTML elements based on events)
- page's properties(methods, events, looks) can be altered
- DOM: **tree with nodes as objects** & JS programs can alter tree
- Not part of ECMA script by default, added by browsers/node.js
	- Functionalities offered are called Web/Auxillary APIs
	- document not provided by node.js

- object-oriented representation of the web page
- built using multiple APIs, infact it is a webAPI itself

- When web browser parses HTML document, it builds a DOM tree(to display HTML).
- JS, Python i.e. a scripting language can alter the DOM(page has reached a new state)
- Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime. 

## Dynamic Website
1. change elements on the website, once the website is loaded
2. generating outputs on the page, once the inputs are provided
	- dom helps in doing this, task further smoothened by react

## Classes vs Ids
- Classes: avoid code repition, majorly (preferrable in CSS)
- Ids: useful for element targeting using DOM majorly
- fetch enables us to get output from a backend complex functionality, easy do on frontend
	- as task of frontend is just to render
- save unnecessary calls to backend using debouncing (1:39:31), implement on own

## Attributes & Methods
- **A common error in DOM processing is to expect an element node to contain text**.
- innerText: returns all html nodes
- textContent: all text content visible/not
- innerHTML: nested elements are totally visible

- setAttribute changes the targeted attribute, so be careful not to overwrite it (create if DNE)
- The write() method deletes all existing HTML when used on a loaded document.
- document.createElement, removeChild, appendChild, replaceChild

### NodeList
- querySelector: returns first element with specified selector, if not found null 
- querySelectorAll:  returns all elements as a NodeList(not array)
	- target: **id, class, tag, CSS selector, HTML object Collections**
- Items can only be accessed by their index number.
- Most often a static collection. Example: If you add a <li> element to a list in the DOM, the list in NodeList will not change.

### HTML Collection
- getElementById, getElementByClassName: return as HTMLCOllection (need to convert to array, as itself not very usable -> Array.from())
- Items can be accessed by their name, id, or index number.
- It is always a live collection. Example: If you add a <li> element to a list in the DOM, the list in the HTMLCollection will also change.

document.anchors, body, documentElement, embeds, forms, head, images, links, scripts, title
- children of an element obtained as HTMLCollection(can be converted to array), similary parents of children can be obtained

### Difference (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-manipulation-htmlcollection-vs-nodelist/)
```
<div>
  This is a text
  <p class="paragraph">First paragraph</p>
  <p class="paragraph">First paragraph</p>
</div>

const divElement = document.querySelector('div')

console.log(divElement.children) // returns an HTMLCollection [p.paragraph, p.paragraph]
console.log(divElement.childNodes) // returns a NodeList [text,p.paragraph, text, p.paragraph, text]

```

v3:
## Relation between Nodes
- document object is the top node of the tree
- can access parent, sibling & children
- **A common error in DOM processing is to expect an element node to contain text**.
parent.childNodes(we see 
- node.childNodes – accesses the child nodes of a selected parent‌‌
	- all the nodes present under the parent: '\n', elements, comments etc)
- node.firstChild – accesses the first child of a selected parent‌‌
- node.lastChild – accesses the last child of a selected parent.‌‌
- node.parentNode – accesses the parent of a selected child node.‌‌
- node.nextSibling – accesses the next consecutive element (sibling) of a selected element.‌‌
- node.previousSibling – accesses the previous element (sibling) of a selected element

## HTML can be altered on the occurence of events
- The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
	- The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version,
	- load the proper version of the web page based on the information.
	- The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies.
- add eventListeners to any DOM object (not HTML elements only)
	- add multiple of same type

- setAttribute changes the targeted attribute, so be careful not to overwrite it.
let x = document.createElement('tag')
- set styles, className, ID
- x.setAttribute(key, val)
- 2 ways to add text (Debate On):
    - x.innerText = "Lol" (need to get & then update)
    - let addTxt = document.createTextNode("Lol"),       x.appendChild(addTxt) (just add: optimized)
- add to HTML document: document.body.appendChild(x)

can functionize 

// gives xth li element irrespective of parent
y = document.querySelector("li:nth-child(x)")
- 2 ways to edit:
    - y.innerHTML = "sdbjebfe"
    - create new li & y.replaceWith(new li)

select ele & .remove()
