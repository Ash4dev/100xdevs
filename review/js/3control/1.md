v1:

implicit scope (avoid generally)

after a key is matched, all code(cases) below it are executed except default. Hence, use break to break the control flow.

cases can also have string vals(only is js not in C/C++)

A falsy (sometimes written falsey) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.

falsy values: false, 0, -0, BigInt 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN

truthy values: "0", "false", " ", [], {}, function(){} & rest

0, false, "": equivalent

let val = null ?? complex function call
ensures that val takes other value


The nullish coalescing operator (??) provides a concise way to assign a default value to a variable if the variable is null or undefined.
(??) considers values that are not null or undefined as truthy.

for..in returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas for..of returns a list of values of the numeric properties of the object being iterated

v3:
 
forEach: doesn't return anything
filter, reduce: too 

whenever we open a scope, we must explicitly return
