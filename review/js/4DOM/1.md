v1:
Document Object Model (DOM) 
- programming interface for web documents.  
- page's properties(methods, events, looks) can be altered
- DOM: tree with nodes as objects & programs can alter tree
- object-oriented representation of the web page
- built using multiple APIs, infact it is a webAPI itself

JS, Python etc can alter the DOM(page has reached a new state)

setAttribute changes the targeted attribute, so be careful not to overwrite it.

innerText: returns all html nodes
textContent: all text content visible/not
innerHTML: nested elements are totally visible

querySelector: returns first element with specified selector, if not found null 
querySelectorAll:  returns all elements as a nodelist(not array)

getElementById, getElementByClassName: return as HTMLCOllection (need to convert to array, as itself not very usable -> Array.from())

v3:

children of an element obtained as HTMLCollection(can be converted to array), similary parents of children can be obtained

can access parent, sibling & children
parent.childNodes(we see all the nodes present under the parent: '\n', elements, comments etc)

let x = document.createElement('tag')
- set styles, className, ID
- x.setAttribute(key, val)
- 2 ways to add text (Debate On):
    - x.innerText = "Lol" (need to get & then update)
    - let addTxt = document.createTextNode("Lol"),       x.appendChild(addTxt) (just add: optimized )
- add to HTML document: document.body.appendChild(x)

can functionize 

// gives xth li element irrespective of parent
y = document.querySelector("li:nth-child(x)")
- 2 ways to edit:
    - y.innerHTML = "sdbjebfe"
    - create new li & y.replaceWith(new li)

select ele & .remove()
