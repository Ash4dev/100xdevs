JS is prototype-based language & classes in it are syntactic sugar. It is not a OOPS based language.

Object literal: comma separated collections of properties(name:val pairs) & methods inside curly braces

Constructor, Prototype, Classes, Instances(new: constructor function, this: current context)

pillars of OOPS:
1. Abstraction: Hide info
2. Inheritence: share info
3. Polymorphism: redfine info
3. Encapsulate: group info

Constructor functions simplify the creation of new objects, ensuring DRY & avoiding any overwriting of context. 

JS is a prototyped-language.
Every thing in JS is an Object. So, we can inherit the properties and methods available with their parents, grandparents & so on. It goes till we reach null. However, we can keep stretching it using getters and setters.

When dealing with unknown objects, look at property descriptors

Prototype of Object available with all, as it is the top-most hierarchy.
